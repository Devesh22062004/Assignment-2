Open the project in your preferred Solidity development environment, such as Remix IDE.

Ensure you have the necessary development tools installed, including Node.js, npm, and Truffle.

Executing program
Compile the smart contract using Remix IDE or your preferred Solidity compiler.

Deploy the contract to your preferred Ethereum network (e.g., Ethereum mainnet, Ropsten, Rinkeby).

Interact with the deployed contract using Remix IDE or a web3 interface.

Example commands:

// Minting tokens
myTokenInstance.mint("0xYourAddress", 100);

// Burning tokens
myTokenInstance.burn("0xYourAddress", 50);
Help
For common issues or troubleshooting, please refer to the following:

Ensure you have sufficient ETH for gas fees when deploying and interacting with the contract.
Make sure the contract address and ABI are correctly referenced in your web3 interface.
// If you encounter issues with deployment or interaction
npx truffle migrate --reset
